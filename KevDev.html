    <h1>KevDev ecommerce store</h1>
    <p>The checkout functionality appears to work as intended. The issue with the checkout process might have to do with the <b>Close</b> button on top of the widget. It remains active even during the card processing, and if inadventently pressed would cause the processing to abort.</p>
    <p>One solution would be to de-activate the button when the user clicks on <b>Submit</b> and re-activate it afterwards so the user is able to close the widget after purchase.</p>

      <form>

      function handleClose(){
	  widget.style.display= "none";
      }

      function handleSubmit(){
	  close.disabled = true;
	  setTimeout(function(){
	      close.disabled = false;
	  }, 5000);
